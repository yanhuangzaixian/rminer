RMiner is based on the core of WEKA, an open source data mining tool. RMiner implements most of the classic and latest role mining algorithms and provides interactive tools for administrator to update role states.

In this demonstration, we show a role mining platform, namely RMiner. In RMiner, we implement most of the classical role mining algorithms, such as ORCA, HierarchicalMiner, CompleteMiner, FastMiner,StateMiner,GraphOptimization,MinimalPerturbation,and WeightedRoleMinning and so on. RMiner also provides a role state editor for updating the role state generated by the role mining algorithms. In addition, RMiner offers some abstract interfaces that the users can easily add new role mining algorithms, and discover the difference of the new algorithms compared with others using the visualization tools.
